some old code in C for doing simple experiments with genetic algorithms

this is just some old code I found while I was cleaning up archives of my files

it's simple, it's a toy genetics program

these programs may be useful to someone for someone looking for GA examples
but they are not very robust and likely have bugs

these are just toy experiments I did for my own amusement some 20 years ago
and do not reflect the latest research in GA algorithm design etc.
